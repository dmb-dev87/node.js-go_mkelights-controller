		    <li><u>12/31/19</u> - Tonight is the last night that you can control our lights. Thank you all SO much for celebrating the season with us. Have a very happy new year! See you next year! ;) </li>	   
		    <li><u>12/23/19</u> - Merry Christmas! Our lights will be online from 5pm-7AM for the next few days. Be sure to shows your family/friends how cool we are at your Christmas parties! </li>
		    <li><u>12/10/19</u> - Given all the recent news coverage, our system is handling 3-4x more concurrent users than normal. I'm tweaking some things in the coding, but given the amount of ON/OFF requests being sent at one time, the system occassionaly gets bogged down. </li>
		    <li><u>12/7/19</u> - We had a 30 minute delay tonight. The remote server disconnected while I was at work so I had to reconnect. All better now!</li>
		    <li><u>12/5/19</u> - Knock on wood, things have been working pretty well the last few nights. Please continue to tell us about any "bugs" that you might encounter. :)</li>
		    <li><u>11/27/19</u> - We've added a second camera this year, but of course it has added some bugs to the system. Don't fret, we will get them squashed as soon as we can.</li>
			<li><u>11/25/19</u> - Everyting is out of the attic and we will start setting up soon.</li>
